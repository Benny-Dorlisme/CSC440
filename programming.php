             I started programming when I got out of high school. I started going on the internet to try to teach myself JAVA and it didn't work out to well. I was reading things that I completely did not understand. I was frustrated but I didn't give up. About a year later I took my first computer science class Computer Programming 101. I learn so much from that class fast forward to now I'm making web sites and video games via computer programming.

                     No matter what language your programming in the computer understands only under stands one language binary.
                     Before I took my first computer science class I took a math class where I learned about different number systems 
                     called bases. As humans we use a number system called base10. It's called base10 because we use ten numbers i.e. 
                     0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Computers on the other hand use base2, 0 and 1. This is the language of the computer and you                     have to be pretty hardcore to program with it.

                     	Because it's so hard to program in binary programmers have created other languages that are more human friendly
                        to code with. The most popular ones are JAVA, C, C++, C#, etc. I learn JAVA first that gave me a foundation in 
                        programming languages then I started playing with a program called <a href"http://www.yoyogames.com">
                        GameMaker.</a> I created this <a href="MegamanUniverse.exe">game</a> from the program. I stopped working on it                        because it wasn't paying the bills so I went on to programming web applications.
